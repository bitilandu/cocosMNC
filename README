Provides a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern for cocos2d for iPhone. Since cocos2d uses nodes instead of views, this implementation is known as a model-node-controller (MNC).

cocosMNC is designed such that there is one view per controller, one controller per view, and one model per controller. However, there may be more than one view-controller pair per model.

This repository has an XCode project included which demonstrates a simple implementation of cocosMNC: the base cocosMNC code is in the "Shared" directory, meant to be shared between various XCode projects.

This version of cocosMNC was only tested with version 0.99.4 of cocos2d.

==================================================

HOW TO USE cocosMNC:

First, make sure to include the AbstractModel, CCNode+Additions, and CCNodeController files to your project (and import them as needed since they are not imported into cocos2d.h).

For the CCNode files, navigate to the libs/cocos2d folder in your project's directory. In there, you must replace the original CCNode.h and CCNode.m files with the cocosMNC versions of those files, which are found in the cocosMNC/Shared directory. (These altered CCNode files should not change the behavior of normal CCNode files--they merely send messages to the CCNode's controller.)

Then, to define custom behavior on receiving touches, subclass CCNodeController and override the normal touch delegate methods (like ccTouchBegan:withEvent:). CCNodeController will automatically register/unregister itself for touch notifications whenever the CCNode is entered or exited.

Finally, subclass AbstractModel to define custom information for the MVC pattern. This subclass is responsible for calling [self didChange] whenever the CCNode should be updated (this could be accomplished, for example, by using properties for variables and manually defining their setter method).

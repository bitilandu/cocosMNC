Provides a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern for cocos2D for iPhone. Since cocos2D uses nodes instead of views, this implementation is known as a model-node-controller (MNC).

cocosMNC is "traditionally" designed: there is one view per controller, one controller per view, and one model per controller. However, there may be more than one view-controller pair per model.

This repository has an XCode project included which demonstrates a simple implementation of cocosMNC: the base cocosMNC code is in the "Shared" directory, meant to be shared between various XCode projects.

cocosMNC has only been tested against the 0.8.2 version of cocos2D. Since cocos2D is still heavily in development and may therefore be unstable, there may be changes to this code base as the main project evolves.
